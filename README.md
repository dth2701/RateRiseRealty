### Inspiration
CBRE states that “No two assets, clients or tenants are the same—that’s why we offer tailored property management solutions to meet your unique needs.” "RateRiseRealty" is designed to simplify the complexities of property management, providing tailored information and insights that cater to the specific needs of property managers. Our goal is to enhance operational efficiency and enable property managers to work smarter, fostering more effective business practices around Dallas.

### What it does
"RateRiseRealty" is a chatbot application designed for property managers, with detailed insights and analytics for apartment properties across 10 big cities near Dallas, including Dallas itself. The chatbot's capabilities include:

Visualizing 10 years' worth of rent data for different cities in both linear and bar graphs.
Predicting the rent price for 2025 based on the past 9 years of data.
Providing additional information on each city, such as crime rates, nearby malls, schools, and distances between cities. By offering these features, "RateRiseRealty" not only simplifies the process of accessing and analyzing property rate data but also enriches the decision-making process with valuable insights into local amenities and safety.

### How we built it
React for the front end and data visualization.
The chatbot's functionality is powered by the react-simple-chatbot library, allowing rapid development and integration of conversational interfaces.
Local city data is stored in JSON format, facilitating quick and efficient data retrieval.

### Challenges we ran into
It is my team's firs time implementing ChatGPT and data visualization. Additionally, our team's limited experience with Python for data visualization prompted us to prioritize developing a user-friendly interface that could deliver value without necessitating complex technical interactions from the users' end.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are particularly proud of:

The visual representation of rent data, making it easy for users to grasp trends at a glance.
Our predictive model's ability to forecast 2025 rent prices with a high degree of accuracy, offers valuable insights for future planning.
What we learned
This project was a journey of discovery, teaching us the power of blending AI with data visualization to solve real-world problems. We learned the intricacies of integrating different technologies to work harmoniously and the importance of user-centered design in developing effective digital solutions.

### What's next for RateRiseRealty
Utilizing Python for Enhanced Graph Visualizations: We plan to leverage Python's powerful data visualization libraries (like Matplotlib) to create more sophisticated and detailed graphs.
Expanding its database to include more detailed insights into property management metrics. This expansion will include historical and predictive data on utility costs, maintenance expenses, occupancy rates, and tenant demographics.
Further refining the chatbot's AI to offer more detailed explanations or simpler summaries as needed.
